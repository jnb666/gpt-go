The roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation  

\[
ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 \qquad (a \neq 0)
\]

are given by the **quadratic formula**:

\[
\boxed{\,x = \frac{-b \;\pm\; \sqrt{\,b^{2}-4ac\,}}{\,2a\,}\,}
\]

* **\(b^{2}-4ac\)** is called the *discriminant*.
  * If the discriminant is positive, you get two distinct real roots.
  * If it is zero, you get one repeated real root.
  * If it is negative, the roots are complex conjugates.

Just plug in the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from your quadratic equation into the formula to find its roots.
